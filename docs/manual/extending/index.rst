Extending Review Board
======================

Review Board is a highly-extensible code review product. Like a browser, anyone
can write extensions that improve the product, adding new features,
enhancing existing ones, changing the look and feel, and integrating with
other services. Here are just a few examples of what you can accomplish by
writing an extension:

* Modify the user interface to provide new review request actions, fields, or
  update the content of e-mails
* Collect statistics and generate reports
* Connect Review Board with other systems (Slack, IRC, Asana, etc.)
* Add new API for collecting or computing custom data
* Implement review UIs for previously unsupported types of files

This guide will cover some of the basics of extension writing, and provide a
reference to the Review Board codebase.


Extension Basics

To begin, you'll want to become familiar with a few of the basics of extension

Python Extension Hooks

Review Board provides what we call "extension hooks," which are areas that an
extension can hook into in order to modify behavior or UI. There are many

Guides to Extending Review Board

We have guides on some of the more common types of extensions you might be
interested in. Note that some of these are still a work-in-progress.

* :ref:`Writing review UIs <extension-review-ui-integration>`
* :ref:`Writing new REST APIs <extension-resources>`
* :ref:`Writing authentication backends <writing-auth-backends>`
* :ref:`Adding review request fields <extension-review-request-fields>`


Code Base Documentation
=======================

When writing extensions, you will be working directly with the same Review
Board classes and methods that we use in the product ourselves.

Please note that not all of these are guaranteed to be API-stable or fully
documented.
